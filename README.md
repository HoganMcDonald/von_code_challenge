# Von 91 Code Challenge

A static webpage recreated from a pdf document as reference.

I generally organized the css file by the order that elements show up on the screen. I attempted to maintain high specificity in my selectors so the page could easily maintain integrity if it were made more complicated. I did place one media query at the bottom of the page so that the layout wouldn't break on mobile. I took some liberty in layout choices at that point because I was only given a desktop layout for reference.

The only Javascript on the page is for the image carousel. All of that can be found in the client.js file.
